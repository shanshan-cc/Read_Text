The Gift of the Magi

Della stood in the center of her small apartment, counting her money for the third time. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had saved this tiny amount with great difficulty. Tears welled in her eyes as she looked around the poorly furnished room. Her greatest treasure was her long, beautiful hair, which fell like a cascade of brown water. Her husband Jim’s pride was a fine gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s.

There were two possessions that brought them great joy. One was Jim’s gold watch. The other was Della’s hair. She knew Jim needed a chain for his watch, a proper one to replace the old leather strap. She had seen it in a shop window — a simple, elegant platinum chain. It was perfect for Jim’s watch.

Suddenly, an idea came to her. She rushed out and her brown hair flowed behind her. She stopped at a sign that read "Hair Goods of All Kinds." With a determined heart, she entered. "Will you buy my hair?" she asked. Twenty minutes later, she left the shop with twenty dollars in her hand and a head wrapped in a simple scarf.

She searched the stores for the perfect gift. Finally, she found it: the platinum watch chain. It cost twenty-one dollars. With her twenty dollars and the extra eighty-seven cents, she managed to buy it. She returned home, excited but anxious about her short hair.

At seven o’clock, Jim came home. He stopped inside the door, his eyes fixed on Della. His expression was strange — not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval. Della ran to him. "Jim, dear," she cried, "don’t look at me that way. I sold my hair to buy you a Christmas gift." She held out the chain. "Isn’t it lovely?"

A slow smile spread across Jim’s face. He drew a package from his coat pocket and handed it to her. "Let’s see what’s inside," he said gently. Her fingers tore at the string and paper. Then came a delighted cry, followed immediately by a sad one. For there lay the set of beautiful combs she had long admired in a shop window — combs with jeweled edges, perfect for her vanished hair.

She looked up with love shining in her eyes. "My hair grows very fast, Jim." Then she remembered his gift and held out the chain. "Your turn," she said.

Jim sat on the couch and smiled. "Della," he said, "let’s put our Christmas gifts away for now. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs."

They were not wise, these two. In their willingness to give up their greatest treasures for each other, they possessed a gift far greater than any chain or comb. They were the magi.
